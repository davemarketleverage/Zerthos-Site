      bio: `Christopher Cochran
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Co-Founder, Zerthos
Christopher Cochran is the Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Zerthos, where he leads
the company's mission to revolutionize data movement through TalonXâ€”a proprietary
compression and transfer protocol that enables near-instant, lossless delivery of large files. Under
his leadership, Zerthos is setting new standards for speed, efficiency, and scalability across
industries including healthcare, defense, enterprise, and media.

With over 30 years of technology experience, Chris has built and scaled high-performing
organizations at the intersection of innovation and execution. He previously served as CEO of
BluChip Solutions, a global project solutions firm specializing in enterprise IT, cloud
infrastructure, and cybersecurity. He currently serves on the Board of Directors for Coeptis, a
public company focused on advancing innovative technologies, and as Board Director of the
Christian Cochran Legacy Fundâ€”a foundation dedicated to supporting underserved
communities and young adult cancer survivors. The fund partners with organizations like Young
Adult Survivors United (YASU) to provide emotional, social, and financial support to those
impacted by cancer.

Chris earned a Bachelor of Science in Business and International Law from the University of
Tennessee, where he was also a Division I wrestler. He is the author of What's GOOD About
